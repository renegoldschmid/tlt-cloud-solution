# LTP Designer

Master Project by Ren√© Goldschmid

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/eacc3f87-e372-4173-9800-1f458b4b4467/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tlt-cloud-solution/deploys)

## Publishing

The latest stable version (currently v1.0) is published at [ltp-designer.netlify.app](https://ltp-designer.netlify.app/)

## Local Development

The app can be run locally, using a modern Webbrowser with JavaScript enabled. Hosting the app on a local server can reduce problems with the CORS Policy, so it is recommended for local development.

## Planned features for future updates

The following features may be added in the future:

- Inspector menu for editing entities
- Custom Perimeters for each entity-type
- Updated Icons for the entity-toolbar
- Export in additional formats
- UI improvements
